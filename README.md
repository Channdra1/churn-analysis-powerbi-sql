End-to-end Telecom Customer Churn Analysis using SQL, ETL, and Power BI
# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer churn using SQL-based ETL processes and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The goal is to identify churn patterns, understand customer behavior, and help businesses reduce churn through data-driven decisions.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server (ETL & Data Transformation)
- Power BI (Visualization & Dashboard)
- Microsoft Excel / CSV
- GitHub (Version)

- ## Key Objectives
- Analyze churn by demographics, geography, services, and payment methods
- Identify high-risk churn customer segments
- Track KPIs such as:
  - Total Customers
  - Total Churn
  - Churn Rate
  - New Joiners
- Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline

- ## ETL Process
1. Raw data loaded into staging table (`stg_Churn`)
2. Data cleaning and NULL handling
3. Transformed data stored in production table (`prod_Churn`)
4. Analytical views created for churned, stayed, and joined customers

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:
- Churn Rate analysis
- Gender-wise & State-wise churn
- Contract & Payment Method insights
- Tenure, Age, and Monthly Charge segmentation

## Key Insights
- Female customers show a higher churn rate than males
- Short-tenure customers churn more frequently
- Certain states contribute disproportionately to churn
- High monthly charges increase churn probability
